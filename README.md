# SFramework
Welcome to SFramework!

## Overview
SFramework is a framework for [CraftStudio](https://sparklinlabs.itch.io/craftstudio) to facilitate easier development of 2D games.

The framework is designed with CraftStudio's current APIs in mind.  For this reason, you'll notice similar function/behavior definitions for various components. The goal of SFramework is to make development of 2D games easy in as many aspects as possible. So, what can it do?
### Sprites
SFramework makes sprites and sprite animation in CraftStudio easier than ever.  Use Font assets to create spritesheets and let SFramework do the rest!

### Simple Physics
SFramework gives you simple 2D physics tools that will help you with collisions and improve character movement.  SFramework comes with both box and circle colliders which work in all directions and orientations!

## Contribute
I welcome contributions to this project!

It is not very intuitive to use CraftStudio with source control, so a tutorial on how you can make contributions can be found [here](https://github.com/mitchwadair/sidescroller-framework/tree/master/doc/Contribute).
