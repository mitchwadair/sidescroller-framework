# SFramework
Welcome to SFramework!

## Overview
SFramework is a framework for [CraftStudio](https://sparklinlabs.itch.io/craftstudio) to facilitate easier development of 2D games.

The framework is designed with CraftStudio's current APIs in mind.  For this reason, you'll notice similar function/behavior definitions for various components.

## Learn
API documentation and tutorials can be found in the [doc](https://github.com/mitchwadair/sidescroller-framework/tree/master/doc) folder of this repository.

If there are any questions or need help with something, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/mitchwadair/sidescroller-framework/issues) and tag it with 'question' or 'help wanted'.

## Contribute
I welcome contributions to this project!

It is not very intuitive to use CraftStudio with source control, so a tutorial on how you can make contributions can be found LINK_TODO
